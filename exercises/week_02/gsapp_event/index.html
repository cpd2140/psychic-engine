    <p><strong>Graphics Project</strong> is an annual series of lectures, discussions, and
        <br>portfolio reviews exploring the role of graphic design within the field
        <br>of architecture organized by <strong>Yoonjai Choi</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>We examine various methods of visual communication used to
        <br>convey concepts to both specialist and general audiences. These
        <br>events aim to help students build a successful graduation portfolio
        <br>while simultaneously unpacking the topics, tools, and trends of
        <br>contemporary graphic design. Past workshop recordings and
        <br>additional resources are available on the Graphics Project Webpage.
    </p>

    <p><em>Graphics Project Workshops are open to all current GSAPP
            <br>Students. Both lectures on this date will occur in the same meeting.
            <br>details on day 2 presentations here.</em>
